2026-01-14 14:20 - Phase 1: Project Setup STARTED
- Initialized Vite + React 19 project with TypeScript
- Created project structure (src/components, src/lib, src/store, src/styles, src/templates)
- Configured package.json with all required dependencies:
  * React 19 + React DOM
  * CodeMirror 6 (instead of Monaco per CLAUDE.md guidance)
  * D3.js 7.9 for visualization
  * Framer Motion 12 for animations

  * Vitest 4 with @testing-library/react and jsdom
- Configured TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Configured Vite with React plugin and Vitest testing setup
- Set up test coverage thresholds (80% statements, 75% branches, 80% functions/lines)
- Created basic App component and test
- Tests passing (1/1) ✓
- Type checking passing ✓
- Dependencies installed successfully

Next: Complete remaining Phase 1 tasks (layout, editor config, Zustand store)

- Implemented split-pane layout using react-resizable-panels
  * Horizontal split with 50/50 default sizing
  * Minimum panel size of 30% for each panel
  * Resizable divider with hover effects
- Added responsive CSS styling for layout components
  * App header with dark background
  * Distinct backgrounds for editor (darker) and visualization panels
  * Resize handle with transition effects
- Created comprehensive tests for all components
  * App.test.tsx: 3 tests covering header and both panels
  * EditorPanel.test.tsx: 2 tests
  * VisualizationPanel.test.tsx: 2 tests
- All tests passing (7/7) ✓
- Type checking passing ✓

Next: Configure CodeMirror 6 editor

2026-01-14 14:27 - Phase 1: CodeMirror 6 Editor COMPLETED
- Installed CodeMirror 6 packages:
  * codemirror (base package with basicSetup)
  * @codemirror/lang-javascript for JavaScript syntax
  * @codemirror/theme-one-dark for dark theme
  * @codemirror/state for EditorState
  * @codemirror/view for EditorView
  * @codemirror/commands, @codemirror/language, @codemirror/autocomplete
- Created CodeMirrorEditor component (src/components/EditorPanel/CodeMirrorEditor.tsx)
  * Uses React refs for D3-style exclusive DOM ownership
  * Configures editor with basicSetup, JavaScript language, oneDark theme
  * Supports value prop and onChange callback
  * Supports readOnly mode
  * Properly cleans up editor on unmount
- Updated EditorPanel to use CodeMirrorEditor
  * Added local state for code with default example
  * Integrated CodeMirrorEditor component
- Added CSS styling for editor layout
  * Flexbox layout for editor panel
  * Header section with styling
  * Full-height CodeMirror wrapper
- Installed oxlint and oxfmt dev dependencies for linting/formatting
- Created comprehensive tests for CodeMirrorEditor (3 tests)
- Updated EditorPanel tests to verify CodeMirror integration
- All tests passing (10/10) ✓
- Type checking passing ✓
- Linting passing (0 warnings, 0 errors) ✓
- Formatting passing ✓
- Full validation suite passing ✓

Next: Set up Zustand store for app state

2026-01-14 14:30 - Phase 1: Zustand Store COMPLETED (Phase 1 COMPLETE)
- Created comprehensive Zustand store (src/store/useAppStore.ts)
  * Data structure selection state (selectedDataStructure, selectedDifficulty)
  * Editor state (userCode, codeStatus)
  * Visualization state (mode, steps, stepIndex, isAnimating, animationSpeed)
  * Test results state (testResults Map, hintsRevealed count)
  * Complete action suite for all state mutations
- Implemented smart state resets:
  * Switching data structures resets difficulty, steps, tests, hints
  * Changing difficulty resets steps and hints (preserves data structure)
- Type-safe interfaces exported:
  * DataStructureType: array | linkedList | stack | queue | tree | graph | hashMap
  * DifficultyLevel: easy | medium | hard
  * VisualizationMode: user-code | expected-output | reference | skeleton
  * VisualizationStep: captures operation type, target, args, result, timestamp
  * TestResult: testId, passed, error, executionTime, steps
- Created comprehensive test suite (src/store/useAppStore.test.ts)
  * 21 tests covering all state and actions
  * Tests for initial state, data structure selection, editor state
  * Tests for visualization state, step navigation, animation controls
  * Tests for test results storage/clearing, hint revelation/reset
  * Uses renderHook and act from @testing-library/react
- All tests passing (31/31) ✓
- Type checking passing ✓
- Linting passing (0 warnings, 0 errors) ✓
- Formatting passing ✓
- Full validation suite passing ✓

Next: Begin Phase 2 - Implement sandboxed iframe execution with srcdoc
