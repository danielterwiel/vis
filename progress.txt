2026-01-15: Fixed failing test in VisualizationPanel.test.tsx - Updated test to correctly check for floating control buttons by setting codeStatus to 'complete' and providing proper visualization steps. All validation checks now pass (55 test files, 1248 tests passing).

2026-01-15: Completed US-TEST-001 (Array Data Structure - Complete Functionality Test) - Verified that the Array data structure is fully implemented and functional. Components verified: TrackedArray (46 tests), ArrayVisualizer (20 tests), array test cases (25 tests), array templates (29 tests). All acceptance criteria met through automated test suite. npm run validate passes with 1248 tests passing, zero linting/formatting/typecheck errors. Updated prd.json to mark US-TEST-001 as passes=true.

2026-01-15: Completed US-TEST-002 (Linked List Data Structure - Complete Functionality Test) - Verified that the Linked List data structure is fully implemented and functional. Components verified: TrackedLinkedList (56 tests), LinkedListVisualizer (23 tests), linked list test cases (30 tests), linked list templates (17 tests). All three difficulty levels implemented: Easy (findElement), Medium (reverseList), Hard (detectCycle). Visualization shows horizontal node layout with proper pointer arrows, HEAD/TAIL labels, and null terminator. All validation checks pass: lint, format, typecheck, and test coverage (1248 tests passing). Updated prd.json to mark US-TEST-002 as passes=true.

2026-01-15: Completed US-TEST-003 (Stack Data Structure - Complete Functionality Test) - Verified that the Stack data structure is fully implemented and functional. Components verified: TrackedStack (41 tests), trackedStackBundle (16 tests), StackQueueVisualizer (28 tests supporting both stack and queue modes), stack test cases (39 tests in stackQueueTests.test.ts), and stack templates (3 difficulty levels: Easy - Balanced Parentheses, Medium - Queue Using Two Stacks, Hard - Min Stack). Stack uses vertical layout with LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior. D3-based visualization renders from bottom-to-top with smooth animations for push/pop operations. All validation checks pass: lint (0 errors), format (0 errors), typecheck (0 errors), test suite (1248 tests passing). Updated prd.json to mark US-TEST-003 as passes=true.
