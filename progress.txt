2026-01-14 14:20 - Phase 1: Project Setup STARTED
- Initialized Vite + React 19 project with TypeScript
- Created project structure (src/components, src/lib, src/store, src/styles, src/templates)

  * D3.js 7.9 for visualization
  * Framer Motion 12 for animations
  * react-resizable-panels 2.1 for layout
  * @swc/wasm-web for code transformation (20-70x faster than Babel)

  * Zustand 5.0 for state management
  * Vitest 4 with @testing-library/react and jsdom
- Configured TypeScript with strict mode enabled
