All validation checks pass: lint (0 errors), format (0 errors), typecheck (0 errors), test suite (1248 tests passing). Updated prd.json to mark US-TEST-004 as passes=true.

2026-01-15: Completed US-TEST-005 (Binary Tree Data Structure - Complete Functionality Test) - Verified that the Binary Tree data structure is fully implemented and functional. Components verified: TrackedBinaryTree (39 tests), BinaryTreeVisualizer (24 tests), binary tree test cases (22 tests), and binary tree templates (3 difficulty levels: Easy - In-Order Traversal, Medium - Validate BST Property, Hard - Balance an Unbalanced BST). D3-based hierarchical tree visualization with proper node layout, animated edges, and color-coded operations (insert=green, search=purple, delete=red, path=orange). TrackedBinaryTree includes insert, search, delete (with 3 cases: leaf/one-child/two-children), three traversal methods (inorder/preorder/postorder), isValidBST validation, and utility methods (getHeight, getSize, toArray, toHierarchy). Sandboxed bundle (trackedBinaryTreeBundle) with 32 tests ensures user code execution in iframe. All validation checks pass: lint (0 errors), format (0 errors), typecheck (0 errors), test suite (1248 tests passing). Updated prd.json to mark US-TEST-005 as passes=true.

2026-01-15: Completed US-TEST-006 (Graph Data Structure - Complete Functionality Test) - Verified that the Graph data structure is fully implemented and functional. Components verified: TrackedGraph (40 tests), GraphVisualizer (30 tests), graph test cases (26 tests), and graph templates (3 difficulty levels: Easy - BFS Traversal, Medium - Cycle Detection, Hard - Dijkstra's Shortest Path). D3-based force-directed graph visualization with physics-based layout, animated traversal highlighting, and color-coded operations (active=green, current=amber, visited=purple, default=blue). TrackedGraph includes addVertex, addEdge, removeVertex, removeEdge, BFS/DFS traversals with step-by-step emission, cycle detection for both directed/undirected graphs, and shortest path (unweighted BFS). Supports both directed and undirected graphs with optional edge weights. Force simulation configured with link distance (100px), repulsion (-300 strength), centering, and collision detection (40px radius). Sandboxed bundle (trackedGraphBundle) with 33 tests ensures user code execution in iframe. All validation checks pass: lint (0 errors), format (0 errors), typecheck (0 errors), test suite (1248 tests passing). Updated prd.json to mark US-TEST-006 as passes=true.
2026-01-15: Completed US-TEST-007 (Hash Map Data Structure - Complete Functionality Test) - Verified that the Hash Map data structure is fully implemented and functional. Created missing test files: hashMapTests.test.ts (17 tests) and trackedHashMapBundle.test.ts (14 tests). Components verified: TrackedHashMap (45 tests), HashMapVisualizer component with D3-based bucket grid visualization (8×2 layout), hash map test cases (3 difficulty levels), and hash map templates. Hash map uses djb2 hash function with separate chaining for collision resolution, automatic resizing at 0.75 load factor threshold, and complete API (set/get/delete/has/clear/resize/keys/values/entries). D3 visualization shows color-coded operations: active (green), collision (orange), found (purple), deleted (red), empty bucket (dark), with entries (blue). Test cases cover: Easy - Basic Get/Set Operations, Medium - Collision Handling with Chaining (small capacity to force collisions), Hard - Character Frequency Counter (practical application). All validation checks pass: lint (0 errors), format (0 errors), typecheck (0 errors), test suite (1286 tests passing, increased from 1248). Updated prd.json to mark US-TEST-007 as passes=true.

2026-01-15: Completed US-TEST-009 (Visualization Mode Switching) - Verified that visualization mode switching is fully implemented and functional. Fixed failing test in EditorPanel.test.tsx by adding Range.prototype.getClientRects mock for CodeMirror layout calculations in test environment. Fixed missing "frequency" keyword in hashMapTests.ts hints array for Hard test case. Components verified: ModeSelector (23 tests), ComparisonView (16 tests), EditorPanel (8 tests), VisualizationPanel (17 tests). Five visualization modes implemented: 'user-code' (My Execution - shows user's code execution), 'expected-output' (Show Expected - always enabled), 'comparison' (Compare - side-by-side user vs expected), 'skeleton' (initial state), and 'reference' (Show Solution - with confirmation dialog). Each mode has dedicated steps storage (userCodeSteps, expectedOutputSteps, referenceSteps) that persists independently when switching modes. Mode switching resets currentStepIndex to 0, preserves steps per mode, and includes auto-switch safety to default to skeleton for invalid states. ModeSelector properly enables/disables buttons based on step availability. ComparisonView synchronizes step indices and handles different step counts. EditorPanel loads reference solution and sets read-only mode when switching to reference. All validation checks pass: lint (0 errors), format (0 errors), typecheck (0 errors), test suite (1287 tests passing, increased from 1286). Updated prd.json to mark US-TEST-009 as passes=true.
