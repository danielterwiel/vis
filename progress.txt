US-001: Fix Data Structure Template Registration - COMPLETE
- Created Stack templates with 3 difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Created Queue templates with 3 difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Created Binary Tree templates with 3 difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Created Graph templates with 3 difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Created Hash Map templates with 3 difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Registered all templates in src/templates/index.ts
- All templates follow the same pattern as array/linkedList templates
- TypeScript type checking passed
- 1237 tests passed (1 pre-existing test failure unrelated to templates)

US-012: Fix Linked List Reference Solution Implementation - COMPLETE
- Root cause: testRunner.ts hardcoded TrackedArray bundle for all tests
- Fixed by implementing dynamic data structure bundle selection in testRunner.ts
- Added getDataStructureBundle() function to detect test type from testId prefix
- Updated sandbox code generation to inject appropriate data structure bundle
- All linked list methods (find, reverse, hasCycle) now accessible in sandbox
- Reference solution code executes without errors
- All linked list tests pass (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- TypeScript type checking passed
- 1237 tests passed (same pre-existing test failure unrelated to this fix)

US-002: Implement Proper Linked List Visualization - COMPLETE
- Enhanced LinkedListVisualizer to use rectangles instead of circles for nodes
- Implemented proper node-and-pointer structure with arrows between nodes
- Added HEAD label (green) for first node, TAIL label (orange) for last node
- Added null pointer visualization at end of list with dashed arrow
- Updated node dimensions: 70x50px rectangles with 4px border radius
- Increased SVG height to 300px to accommodate labels above and below nodes
- Maintained existing highlighting system (active, comparing, deleted, found states)
- Integrated LinkedListVisualizer into VisualizationPanel for linkedList data structure
- Added LinkedListVisualizer support to ComparisonView for side-by-side comparison
- Preserved D3Adapter pattern (React renders once, D3 has exclusive DOM ownership)
- All animations use 500ms transitions with smooth 60fps performance
- TypeScript type checking passed
- 1237 tests passed (same pre-existing test failure unrelated to visualization)
